# Country Club SQL Case Study

## Overview

Welcome to the SQL mini project. You will carry out this project partly in
the PHPMyAdmin interface, and partly in Jupyter via a Python connection.

The data you need is in the "country_club" database. This database
contains 3 tables:

    i) the "Bookings" table,
    
    ii) the "Facilities" table, and
    
    iii) the "Members" table.
    
In this case study, you will be asked a series of questions to extract different information through SQL queries from the "country_club" database.
